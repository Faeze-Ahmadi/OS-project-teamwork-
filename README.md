# OS team project

As a preliminary description, we should say that the goal of this project is to develop a Python script to take images from the Unsplash website, categorize and store each image in its own directory and improve metadata through artificial intelligence through PhotoTag.ai. The system generates JSON files for each image detailing the media rating/filing as well as the removal. This project will explore both serial and multithreaded programming approaches along with AI-enhanced metadata generation.
